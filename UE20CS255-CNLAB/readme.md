# CN Lab folder 


## Why the mess in naming?

My particular prof seems to have messed up the order of experiment, ANNNNND I dont like it, so ill make a list of order down here 

The naming of folder is as per previous semesters and Animesh sirs posts on edmodo


Supposedly they have changed the order from the last sem courses and hence the confusion, any 
way i like the order from previous sem...so that's what I'll be using.

- Week-1 : Week-1 everywhere 
- Week-6 : Week-2 submission 
- Week-7 : Week-3 submission  
- Week-2_3 : Week-4 submission - Yeah they have merged two weeks to one for us, a little too much 
  - 1 : Setting up server 
  - 2 : Non persistent connections 
  - 3 : Persistent Connections
  - 4 : Authentication 
  - 5 : Cookies using PHP scripts : https://gist.github.com/superjojo140/18e250786d977b27571124f81bba5018
- Week-4 : Week-5 submission
- Week-5 real : Alloted 6 hours for CN lab assignment/Project 
- Week-6 real : assignment/Project
- Week-7 real : assignment/Project
- Week-5 : Ive given up trying to follow last years naming scheme. anyhow, this the week with analysing UDP and TCP packets in wireshark.
