# MPCA Assignment 

## Program 1 

- r0 : holds number of elements in the array 
- r1 : starts with initial array start 
- r2 : starts with initial array end 
- r3 : Hold search value
- The termination condition and middle element calculation is messy at best, even if u ask me to explain in person ill have quite a hard time xD.
